          Perfect Forehand in 3 Easy Steps - Tennis Forehand Technique Lesson.
          We all love the feeling of hitting the perfect forehand when you are timing the shot and giving the ball just the right amount of power and spin in a relaxed way. In order to stay fully relaxed and produce effortless power and spin, we need to make sure we follow 3 simple steps to achieve this.
          1. The take-back - making sure you have a deep swing but one that is generated by the body turn (unit turn) separating your shoulders from your hip and creating a nice coiling effect. The left-arm going across the body will help you do this and ensure you are not taking your racquet back too far. Make sure your racquet head does not bend behind the body for ATP Forehand so keep the racquet on your right. WTA Forehand players tend to let it go behind for more power and racquet momentum but less wrist snap and less ability to create top-spin.
          2. The contact - this will ensure the direction of the ball so it is vital you have the racquet face pointing away from you slightly in front (somewhere around where you front toe is). The path of the racquet needs to continue going in a linear way as much as possible through contact (avoid the semi-circle) and don't pull your arm across your body.
          3. The finish - ensuring a good follow-through is vital. Don't stop your arm, let it go through all the way to stay loose and smooth. having a high elbow finish helps get a nice low to high trajectory and also makes it easy to apply topspin as its easier to rotate your wrist. Even if you do not finish in a classic way over your shoulder still ensure to have a high elbow.

      Tennis Forehand Transformation - Technique For Maximum Power and Control. In this video lesson, Top Tennis Training coach Simon Konov is working on his student's forehand technique, the player struggles with timing, power and consistency on his forehand. The key elements that they focus on are:
      Early preparation on the forehand with the racket and non-hitting separating earlier in the swing, if the left-hand stays on the racket for too long the player will struggle with timing the contact in front of the body. 
      Reaching a good power position on the forehand - if the non-hitting hand stays on the racket for too long the end result will be rushing during the forward phase of the swing but it also means the player doesn't reach a good power position. The power position is where the non-hitting hand is across the body, almost in line with the baseline, the racket head is higher than the grip level creating leverage in the racket and hand and the body is coiled up, ready to uncoil on the forward phase of the swing.
      Weight transfer and full rotation - Simon's student struggles to open up the shoulders fully on the finish and this blocks the amount of power he can generate. By uncoiling fully on the forward phase you can generate maximum power and control of the shot plus the weight transfer becomes much easier when done correctly.

              Simple Tennis Forehand Power Trick - Tennis Forehand Lesson
              In this video, Top Tennis Training coach Simon Konov will help you get more power on your forehand with one simple trick.
              The key to more power on any shot is racket head speed. Leverage on any shot will give you the force over the ball, but also allow the space to accelerate your racket in the most energy-efficient way.
              By simply starting your forehand with the racket head up like Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal you will be gaining more leverage right from the start of the stroke along with saving time later in the swing with the lag position.

          Tennis Forehand Topspin - 3 Ways To Get More Topspin On Your Forehand. Tennis players around the world want to generate more topspin on their forehands but don't know how to do so. In this tennis video lesson, coach Simon Konov of Top Tennis Training will show you three different ways to get massive topspin on your tennis forehand. 
          When we want more power on our tennis forehand, it's important to try to flatten out the shot and extend the racket and hand towards our target, so the swing path becomes a more linear one.
          When we want more topspin however, the spin path changes to a more vertical one. Imagine the ball as a clock face, six o'clock at the bottom and twelve o'clock at the top, when we want to hit with more topspin on our forehands, we want to try to brush upwards on the ball going from six to twelve o'clock. This vertical swing path allows us to use a low to high racket path.
          Here are the three steps to getting more topspin on your forehand in tennis:
          Step One - Using a low to high swing path which will allow you to brush upwards on the ball. 6-12 o'clock on the clock face.
          Step Two - Dropping the racket head below the contact point. Many players struggle with this step, they tend to bring the racket head on the same level as the ball and then brush up, so they only use 50% of their upwards potential. Try to feel the entire racket head has dropped below the contact point which will allow you to brush upwards fully during the contact zone.
          Step Three - Using the legs to drive upwards on the ball. When you want more topspin on your forehand, it's a good idea to use an open-stance forehand or a semi-open stance forehand. This will allow you to really load up on the outside leg which is the right leg for right-handed players, then push up off the ground creating good ground force which will result in a more explosive upwards motion with the racket.

    description: `Tennis Two-Handed Backhand | 3 Steps To The Perfect Two Hander
      In this video Top Tennis Training coaches, Simon Konov and Alex Slabinsky will help you perfect your double-handed backhand using 3 simple steps.
      The initial thing to focus on is your grip and how you wait in the ready position. After you identify that the ball is coming to your backhand, the 3 steps are - 
      1. A good unit turn and moving sideways onto the ball (can have your chin touching your right shoulder in this position to aid the turn)
      2. Reaching a good power position with the racket head up higher than the grip level generating good leverage (force over the ball) and space to accelerate the racket
      3. A good finish with a full rotation of the shoulders and hips, including the back leg and finishing with the racket and arms over your right shoulder (if right-handed) 
      Follow these three steps and you will see a huge difference already in your backhand.

      In this video I go through a series of drills that will allow you to ingraining the perfect backhand grips so that you will be able to automatically square up on those shots and start hitting the best backhands of your life. It all starts with the grip.

    description: `Tennis Workout - Top 5 Exercises For Tennis Players.
      This tennis workout routine can be done anywhere. You can use this tennis workout in the gym or this tennis workout on the court. You can also use this as a home tennis workout. There are many ways you can improve your tennis conditioning and get stronger for tennis without having to go to the gym.
      In this video Top Tennis Training coach Simon Konov will demonstrate five of the best exercises for tennis players.
      To do these you only need a resistance band.
      Tennis Workout:
      1. The first exercise is the jumping lunge. Great for developing explosive power in your legs, this will translate into stronger legs for wider balls, open stance shots, low volleys and cutting off wide returns.
      2. Exercise two is the explosive split step, you jump over a line and back to develop explosive power in the lower legs, the calf muscles. These muslces are responsible for your push off when split stepping and the first step to the ball. Build up these muscles and you'll be faster to the ball from the initial push.
      3. Exercise three will help you develop more rotational power through the trunk. The strong, explosive core is fundamental to playing tennis to a high level. These exercises will help you develop that explosive power for your tennis forehand and tennis backhand, along with your tennis return of serve.
      4. The fourth exercise is the reverse fly, this will help you build up a strong scapula region and the upper back muscles. These muslces are a big part of having a good posture and typically tennis players are much stronger in the chest and front shoulder muslces due to the forward phase of most tennis swings.
      5. The fifth exercise is for the rotator cuff muscle, located at the back of the shoulder. When we serve, we stress this region greatly, especially if we are serving a high speeds. That's why it's important to develop a strong shoulder region, to help prevent injuries and help you serve bigger.
      These five tennis specific exercises will be commonly used amongst pro tennis players as a basic workout routine.`,

        Tennis Workout - Top 10 Exercises To Improve Your Game
        When it comes to improving your game, many people think they need to spend countless hours simply hitting balls. That may make you a better ball striker, but it won't make you a tennis athlete. 
        To become faster on the court, reach more balls, have more power with your tennis forehand, backhand, and serve and be more explosive in your game, you need to do tennis-specific workouts.
        In this free tennis lesson, Top Tennis Training coach Simon Konov will show you a tennis workout that can be done on the tennis court, with 10 of the top exercises that tennis players can do to improve their game.
  
        Top 10 Exercises To Improve Your Game:
  
        Exercise One - Explosive Lateral Movement. Building explosive power in your leg muscles should be a major priority when you're training for tennis. In this drill, you start on one leg on one of the tramlines, then explode off the ground and jump over to the other tramline. There and back would equal one repetition, go for 8-10 in a row, and 2-3 sets of this drill.
        Exercise Two - Explosive Split Step. The split step is the most important footwork step in tennis, in this drill, you'll be building more explosive power for your split step and reinforce the motion. Set up a hurdle, it could be anything from 1-2 inches to a couple of feet, it will depend on your current fitness levels and what your body is capable of. Start behind the hurdle in your split step position and jump over the hurdle and back. That would be one rep, go for 8-10 reps per set and 2-3 sets of this drill.
        Exercise Three - Forearm Stability. When we make contact on any stroke, the racket is held in place, in large part by your wrist and forearm muscles. If you're weak in these areas, the racket is likely to move when you're dealing with a more powerful ball. In these two exercises, you'll be developing good strength in your forearm muscles. The first one is done with your palm facing the ground, let your wrist flop down into wrist flexion, and then bring your wrist up into wrist extension. Then return down into wrist flexion for one rep. Go for 10 reps per set with this drill. 
        The second exercise is for the opposite side of your forearm muscles, now you'll have your palm facing towards the sky and you'll start in wrist extension and then flex your forearm muscles so that your wrist ends up in wrist flexion. Once again go for 10 reps per set. With both of these exercises, you may need to do more than 3 sets, normally 4-5 sets work well in building up muscles in this region.
        Exercise Four - Core Stability. The plank is one of the best exercises for tennis players but it's also very stationary, a good alternative however is the press up into the plank position. Start off in a normal press-up position and then go into the plank position on your elbows, then return back into the press-up position, this would be one rep. Go for 10 reps per set and for 3 sets of this exercise.
        Exercise Five - Skipping. Skipping is one of the best ways you can improve your footwork for tennis. As you need to be light and use the balls of your feet when skipping, this mimics the exact motions we want to have when we're playing tennis, light, and on the balls of our feet when moving on the tennis court. There are three simple drills you can do to improve your tennis using skipping, the first one being normal skipping, the second drill is starting off with your feet together, and then going into a split step and the third drill is running on the spot. Go for 100 reps on each drill.
        Exercise Six - Leg Balance and Stability. One leg drills are a great way to develop explosive power in each leg but also develop great stability and balance. Federer uses one leg drills a lot in his training routine, it's one of the main reasons he's so explosive and powerful on court with his movement.
        If you can't move on one leg, you can simply shadow your forehand and backhand on one leg, on the spot. For the more advanced players out there, set up a few cones around 8-10 feet apart. Start at the first cone and then hop to the second cone, shadow your forehand or backhand stroke and return to the first cone. Go for 4-6 reps per set on each leg and 2-3 sets in total.
        Remember to work your weaker leg too!
